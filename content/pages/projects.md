Term Project
------------

Every student is required to complete a term project. The objective of this task is that each student obtains hands-on experience in solving analysis problems using a typical finite element code. The term project should address a problem solution in solids and structures, fluid flows or fluid-structure interactions using [ADINA](http://www.adina.com/).

Some suggested projects:

1.  Large deformation analysis of a rubber sheet with holes.
2.  Large deformation analysis of a thick-walled rubber cylinder subjected to internal pressure.
3.  Large displacement collapse analysis of an elastic thin structure (beam, plate, shell structure).
4.  Elasto-plastic collapse analysis of a structure, for example a truss bridge.
5.  Thermal stress analysis of a structure.
6.  Analysis of fluid flow in a chamber or around an obstruction.
7.  Analysis of a forced or natural convection fluid flow problem.
8.  Analysis of a fluid-structure interaction problem.
9.  Analysis of a problem related to your research.
10.  Develop a nonlinear finite element program based on STAP. (See {{% resource_link 0491563b-205c-806a-31f9-c819bfdf2041 "textbook" %}})

**Note:** Please choose a (tractable) problem that you can analyze in depth in the very limited time available.

The project work is typically started around the beginning of March and typically involves the following steps:

*   Choose a physical problem and consider a "simple" mathematical model of the problem (geometry, loading, material data, boundary conditions) such that in the first instance you can compare your finite element solution results with some analytical results.
*   Solve this "simple" mathematical model using ADINA. Obtain an accurate solution by choosing appropriate elements and meshes.
*   Next increase the complexity of the mathematical model (for example, assume that the material response is nonlinear) and re-solve. Obtain an accurate solution. Ask "what if" questions and experiment with the finite element method.
*   In each case, interpret the calculated response considering the accuracy of the solution of the mathematical model and the adequacy of the mathematical model for the physical problem.

Please hand-in on March 4, 2008 a short description (a few sentences) of the project you would like to select. This description must be approved for you to proceed.
